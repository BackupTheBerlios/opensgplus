Description:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
The directory "ReflectiveMaterial" contains the base classes to
represent the reflective material (environmant mapping type: CubeMapping). Moreover,
there is auxiliary class SimpleSphericalHarmonics which serves for computation
of the basis functions and coefficients to represent the reflectance model
with help of spherical harmonics. Additionaly, there are two files with
3D-objects (this objects will be reflective) and a couple of textures for
environment and for object.
