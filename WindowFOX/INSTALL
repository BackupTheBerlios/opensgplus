OpenSG Window and FOX Widget for the gui toolkit FOX
====================================================

For information on FOX see http://www.fox-toolkit.org
(Tested with FOX version 1.0.7, Windows and RedHat-Linux!)

To compile this optional package you need 
the FOX include directory in the OpenSG include path, 
the FOX library directory in the OpenSG library path 
and you have to link the FOX library.

For this configure OpenSG with the following options added
(You have to change the paths according to your system!)
--with-add-incdir=/cygdrive/e/extern/fox-0.99.181/include 
--with-add-libdir=/cygdrive/e/extern/fox-0.99.181/lib 
--with-add-lib=fox
