This directory contains a volume rendering library for OpenSG.


Revision:

Date:    10/10/2002
Version: This is a 0.9 beta - try at your own risk.
	 (The interfaces might still change occationally)


Compatibility:

The current library can be build with OpenSG-1.1.0. It should also
run with the current OpenSG-Snapshot if you delete the
"#define MW_OSG_1_1" in OSGVolRenDef.h.

However we are not testing compatibility with the Snapshot every
day so try it on your own risk.


Build:

The VolRen-Lib is fully integrated with the OpenSG-1.1.0 build tree.
So in order to build just checkout the module VolRen in the OpenSG
source tree and then configure, make should do.


How to use:

There is a utility function in "makeVolume.cpp" showing the correct
instantiation of a volume node with all required field containers.
You can simply plug this into your application and voila a volume will
show up ;) You can use the included data file for testing. All other
3D-Image formats supported by OpenSG should be ok too.
