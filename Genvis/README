Datastructures for Spatialization and Collision Detection
=========================================================

Contact: Christoph Fünfzig, c.fuenfzig@tu-bs.de

Usage:

This package contains additional datastructures (k-DOP hierarchies
and regular grid) on the scenegraphs Geometry nodes 
for several applications
* spatialization (using k-DOP hierarchies)
* point location (using k-DOP hierarchies)
* ray intersection (using k-DOP hierarchies or regular grid)
* vertex clustering (using regular grid and adaptive grid)
See the test programs...


Compilation:

For the sources in RapidCollision/ you need the package RAPID, Version 2.01
You can get it for non-commercial use at 
http://www.cs.unc.edu/~geom/OBB/OBBT.html
There is also a define GV_WITH_RAPID in OSGGVBase.h to use the library
RAPID or not.

CYGWIN/autoconf/make
For this configure OpenSG with the following options added
(You have to change the paths according to your system!)
--with-add-incdir=/cygdrive/e/extern/RAPID/include
--with-add-libdir=/cygdrive/e/extern/RAPID/lib 
--with-add-lib=RAPID

VISUAL STUDIO 7
The projectfile GenvisLib.vcproj is intended to be in the directory
VSBuild/VS7/GenvisLib.
