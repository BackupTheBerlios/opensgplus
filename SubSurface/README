===========================================

Usage:

The dynamic subdivision surfaces tesselation is implemented currently
for the Catmull-Clark type (with creases) on quad meshes.
For an example have a look at the test program testDynamicSubdivisionCC.cpp.
./testDynamicSubdivisionCC.cpp lbox.obj
with keys 's' solid shading
          'w' wireframe shading
          ESC exit


Compilation:

To compile this package you need the OpenMesh, see http://www.openmesh.org
(for example version 1.0.0.pre3 tested).
Simplest you compile all files *.cc (reader, writer) into a static library 
OpenMesh.

For this configure OpenSG with the following options added
(You have to change the paths according to your system!)
--with-add-incdir=/cygdrive/e/extern
--with-add-libdir=/cygdrive/e/extern/OpenMesh/lib 
--with-add-lib=OpenMesh
