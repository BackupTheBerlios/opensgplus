Dynamic Tesselation of Subdivision Surfaces 
===========================================

Usage:

The dynamic subdivision surfaces tesselation is implemented
for the Catmull-Clark type (with creases) on quad meshes
for the Loop type (with creases) on tri meshes.
For an example have a look at the test program testDynamicSubdivisionCC.cpp.
./testDynamicSubdivisionCC.cpp lbox.obj
with keys 's' solid shading
          'w' wireframe shading
          ESC exit


Compilation:

To compile this package you need the OpenMesh, see http://www.openmesh.org
* Version 1.0.0.beta4 tested

Because the OpenMesh package contains a few *.cc (reader, writer) files, 
you have to add OpenMesh as an external library
* Compile all files *.cc into a static library OpenMesh.
  Then configure OpenSG with the following options added
  (You have to change the paths according to your system!)
  --with-add-incdir=/cygdrive/e/extern/OpenMesh-1.0.0.beta4
  --with-add-libdir=/cygdrive/e/extern/OpenMesh-1.0.0.beta4/lib
  --with-add-lib=OpenMesh
