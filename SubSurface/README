Dynamic Tesselation of Subdivision Surfaces 
===========================================

Contact: Volker Settgast,   v.settgast@tu-bs.de

Usage:

The dynamic subdivision surfaces tesselation is implemented
for the Catmull-Clark type (with creases) on quad meshes
for the Loop type (with creases) on tri meshes.
For an example have a look at the test program testDynamicSubdivisionCC.cpp.
./testDynamicSubdivisionCC.cpp lbox.obj
with keys 's' solid shading
          'w' wireframe shading
          ESC exit


Compilation:

To compile this package you need the OpenMesh, see http://www.openmesh.org
(for example version 1.0.0.b2 and 1.0.0.b3 tested).

Because the OpenMesh package contains a few *.cc (reader, writer) files, 
there are two possibilities
* Copy all files *.cc into OSG*.cpp files into directory SubSurface.
  Then configure OpenSG with the following options added
  (You have to change the paths according to your system!)
  --with-add-incdir=/cygdrive/e/extern/OpenMesh-1.0.0.b2
  --with-add-libdir=
  --with-add-lib=

* Compile all files *.cc into a static library OpenMesh.
  Then configure OpenSG with the following options added
  (You have to change the paths according to your system!)
  --with-add-incdir=/cygdrive/e/extern/OpenMesh-1.0.0.b2
  --with-add-libdir=/cygdrive/e/extern/OpenMesh-1.0.0.b2/lib
  --with-add-lib=OpenMesh
