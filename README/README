OpenSG PLUS CVS Repository
==========================

Thsi CVS repository contains the working code of the OpenSG PLUS project.

OpenSG PLUS is based on the OpenSG Open Source scene graph library, and the
developments from this project will eventually be folded into the official
OpenSG source tree.

For details on OpenSG and OpenSG PLUS please visit www.opensg.org.

This repository contains a number of modules that can be used independently.

OcclusionTest           Occlusion Culling
WindowFOX               Bindings to use OpenSg with the FOX window library
HowToExtend             instructions how to add a new directory to OpenSG

To integrate these modules into the OpenSG source tree go into the
Experimental directory and check them out using "cvs -z3
-d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.OpenSGPLUS.berlios.de:/cvsroot/opensgplus co
modulename". 

After adding one of these modules to your source tree you will have to
reconfigure and recompile. This will compile and link the new features into
OpenSG.

If you have general questions about OpenSG and OpenSG PLUS send email to
info@opensg.org. For questions about the specific modules, check the README
files in the module directories.
